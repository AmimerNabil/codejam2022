Hi, Welcome to the repository for our CodeJam 2022 project!
CodeJam 2022 is the first hackathon experience for most of our team, and we are very excited to present our product.

We have built and designed a fully functioning web app that allows students to upload their course syllabuses to a website that reads through the entire file while looking for important dates such as exams, or assignments. Our website then creates spreadsheet containing all of the dates with the title of the work associated to it.
The website also implements a Google Calendar API in order to automatically add the exam/assignment dates on a calender.

In order to get the information from the course syllabus, we use the Amazon Textract API that can extract forms, tables, and plain text from .pdf files. Since our goal is to take note of submission and examination dates, we only extract data from tables.


AMAZON TEXTRACT API DOES NOT SUPPORT PDF ANYMORE SO WE HAD TO BLA BLA BLA
