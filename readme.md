Hi, Welcome to the repository for our CodeJam 2022 project! 

CodeJam 2022 is the first hackathon experience for most of our team, and we are very excited to present our product *Save The Date*.

We have built and designed a fully functioning web app that allows students to upload their course syllabuses to a website that reads through the entire file while looking for important dates such as exams, presentations or assignments. Our website then creates spreadsheet containing all of the dates with the title of the work associated to it.
The website also implements a Google Calendar API in order to automatically add the exam/assignment dates on a calender.

In order to get the information from the course syllabus, we use the Amazon Textract API that can extract forms, tables, and plain text from .pdf files. Since our goal is to take note of submission and examination dates, we only extract data from tables.

### **INSPIRATION:**
Whether you are a student in high school, CEGEP or university, it is very important to stay up to date with all the assigned tasks. During those caffeine-intensive exam sessions, it can be very easy to forget about a seemingly meaningless assignment. To stay ahead of the workload, many students use agendas to write down important dates. While it is very beneficial to do so, many students avoid agendas because of the time it takes to write down all the dates and to keep up with everything. Our goal for this project was to make the use of a planner as efficient as possible by automating the process of writing down evaluation dates.

### **WHAT IT DOES**
*Save The Date* is a website that makes the long and tedious task of organizing an agenda simple and efficient. The website contains a window where a user can drop a .pdf file. Our website
