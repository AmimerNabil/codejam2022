CEAB curriculum category content ,Number of AU's ,Description ,
Math ,0 ,Mathematics include appropriate elements of linear algebra, differential and integral calculus, differential equations, probability, statistics, numerical analysis, and discrete mathematics. ,
Natural science ,0 ,Natural science includes elements of physics and chemistry, as well as life sciences and earth sciences. The subjects are intended to impart an understanding of natural phenomena and relationships through the use of analytical and/or experimental techniques. ,
Complementary studies ,0 ,Complementary studies include the following areas of study to complement the technical content of the curriculum: engineering economics and project management; the impact of technology on society; subject matter that deals with the arts, humanities and social sciences; management; oral and written communications; health and safety; professionalism, ethics, equity and law; and sustainable development and environmental stewardship. ,
Engineering science ,26 ,Engineering science involves the application of mathematics and natural science to practical problems. They may involve the development of mathematical or numerical techniques, modeling, simulation, and experimental procedures. Such subjects include, among others, applied aspects of strength of materials, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, electrical and electronic circuits, soil mechanics, automatic control, aerodynamics, transport phenomena, elements of materials science, geoscience, computer science, and environmental science. ,
Engineering design ,26 ,Engineering design integrates mathematics, natural sciences, engineering sciences, and complementary studies in order to develop elements, systems, and processes to meet specific needs. It is a creative, iterative, and open-ended process, subject to constraints which may be governed by standards or legislation to varying degrees depending upon the discipline. These constraints may also relate to economic, health, safety, environmental, societal or other interdisciplinary factors. ,
